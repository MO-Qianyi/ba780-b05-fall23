## Used Car Sales in the United States

Project contributors: Asra Ahmed, Ahmed Farid Khan, Qianyi Mo, Varun Kaza, Xiang Liu, and Xinyuan Hu

### Objective
The proposed project aims to comprehensively investigate the relationship between the features and condition of a car, and the price at which it is listed for sale on Craigslist. We seek to accomplish the following objectives:
* Identify the main variables that influence used car prices
* Identify the geographic distribution of car listings and understand whether prices differ based on the location
* Develop predictive models to forecast pricing patterns based on the features of a car

**Data Source**: We will draw upon the extensive dataset provided on Kaggle, which is regularly updated by a data scraper on Craigslist, created by Austin Reese. Because it is updated in its raw form, there is a lot of data cleaning needed. It can be accessed on this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data.

**Motivation**: Recent strikes by auto-workers in the United States have halted the production of new cars at automobile manufacturers like Ford. This could increase used car sales. Analyses will provide meaningful insights and trends in pricing and market strategies, and enable both buyers and sellers to make a fair trade.

### Report Summary
Analyzing a robust dataset from Craigslist, initially teeming with over 400,000 rows, our data exploration unveiled a landscape rife with errors and outliers. Rigorous cleaning ensued, involving column drops, outlier removal, and meticulous value imputation. Within this data, we discerned a nuanced perspective on car pricing dynamics. Luxury brands like Ferrari, Tesla, and Aston Martin emerged as price influencers, skewing averages due to their scarcity on the platform. Notably, even second-hand offerings from these marques exceeded the median US salary. Our investigation further delved into geographical price distribution trends. Armed with these insights, we constructed an interactive predictive model utilizing multiple linear regression. This model, considering diverse car attributes, empowers users to gauge fair prices and align listings with historical trends, fostering transparency in online car transactions.
